Finally range (31k to 31500) has broken on Tuesday.

Now the supply zone (32075-32325) may stop Nifty this week and expected supply zone reach on Wed.

31450-31500 will be nearest support level for it.

If #nifty can break that level then 14440/14800+ possible

If unable to break then some correction expected upto 13400
