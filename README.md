## Overview

This project leverages sentiment analysis to predict stock price and volatility trends by analyzing sentiment in financial news and other relevant text data. By combining natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms, this repository aims to establish connections between market sentiment and stock performance, providing insights into the influence of public sentiment on stock price movements and volatility.

## Key Features

- **Sentiment Analysis**: Uses NLP to analyze financial news and extract sentiment metrics.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Applies machine learning models to predict stock price and volatility trends.
- **Data Visualization**: Visualizes relationships between sentiment, stock price, and volatility.
- **Comprehensive Pipeline**: A structured pipeline that integrates data extraction, sentiment scoring, model training, and evaluation.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: To perform sentiment analysis.
- **Machine Learning (ML)**: For predictive modeling of stock price and volatility.
- **Libraries**:
  - `scikit-learn` for model training and evaluation.
  - `NLTK` and `TextBlob` for sentiment analysis.
  - `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for data visualization.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/hdaga17/Sentiment-Analysis-for-Stock-Price-and-Volatility-Prediction.git
    ```
2. **Install Requirements**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run the Analysis**:
    - Use the provided Jupyter notebooks in `notebooks/` to explore data and run initial analyses.
    - Modify scripts in `src/` to tailor the model pipeline as needed.

## How It Works

1. **Data Collection**: Gathers historical stock price data and corresponding news articles or sentiment indicators.
2. **Sentiment Analysis**: Processes text data to extract sentiment scores for each time period.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Creates features based on sentiment and combines them with historical stock data.
4. **Model Training**: Trains predictive models to forecast stock price and volatility changes.
5. **Evaluation**: Assesses model performance and visualizes results.

## Results

Detailed results, including performance metrics, are available in the analysis notebooks in `notebooks/`. These results help identify correlations between sentiment scores and stock market metrics.

## Future Work

- **Enhanced Sentiment Scoring**: Integrate additional sentiment scoring tools like VADER or financial-specific lexicons.
- **Additional Data Sources**: Incorporate data from other financial platforms or social media for richer sentiment analysis.
- **Real-Time Prediction**: Adapt the pipeline to allow for real-time sentiment analysis and prediction.
